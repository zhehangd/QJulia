Hello, this is the first distribution of my QJulia program. The program is
still in the very begining stage, but at least you already can use it to
do something. This is program that draws "Quaternion Julia Fractals". If
you have no idea what it is, please first google "Fractal", then "Julia Set",
and at last "Quaternion Julia Fractal/Set".

I wish I can develop a standalone program with no library dependency, but I
am not powerful enough yet. It is quite inconvenient when using this program.
First, you have to change all parameters inside the code, rather than type
argument in the command line. Second, the output is raw data, not common bmp,
png, or jpeg. If you have GIMP or Photoshop, you can open the image using them.
------------------------------------
Some of parameters have been avaliable via the command line.2016.02.08

I develop the program using gcc 4.9.2 in Ubuntu. If you are using Linux you
can run [make] command to compile the code. Note that some C++11 features
are used. Make sure your compiler supports it.

There is a demo video in my exhibits. This is how it is produced. First I 
modified my main() function, adding a for loop to generate all the frames. Then
I use ImageMagic to convert them to .png format. Then go to ffmpeg, assemble
these images to a video. I hope this can help you if you want to make your own
outcomes.
